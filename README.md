# DAX-Sales-Practice
Calculate deep aspect of business applying DAX to build model and measures.

We have a database of sales of the global retail company. We want to see how good we are at delivering orders to customers worldwide.

By using DAX to build models and measures, we can see how long it takes a particular order to arrive at the customer's door since they paid.

The result is a matrix of countries and delivery days filled with the percentage of delivered orders vs. total orders. Next, we have a slicer for each brand if we want to look at the details.
