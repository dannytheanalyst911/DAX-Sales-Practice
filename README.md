# DAX-Sales-Practice
Calculate deep aspect of business applying DAX to build model and measures.

We have a database of sales of the global retail company.
We want to see how good we are in delivering orders to customers all around the world.

By using DAX to build model and measures, we can see how long it takes particular order to arrive at customer's door since they payed.

The result is a matrix of countries and delivery days filling with percentage of deliveried orders vs. total orders. Next to it we have a slicer
of each brands if we want to look at details.
